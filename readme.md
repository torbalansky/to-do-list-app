## Simple To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list app that I built as one of my first coding projects. It allows you to add, edit, and remove tasks. It also displays the current date and time.

### Features

- Add new tasks by typing in the input field and pressing Enter.
- Edit tasks by clicking on them.
- Remove tasks by clicking the "X" button next to them.
- Displays the current date and time.
- Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the app.
